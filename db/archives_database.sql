'On the planet Tython, the ancient Je''daii order was founded. And at the feet of its wise Masters, Lanoree Brock learned the mysteries and methods of the Force - and found her calling as one of its most powerful disciples. But as strongly as the Force flowed within Lanoree and her parents, it remained absent in her brother, who grew to despise and shun the Je''daii, and whose training in its ancient ways ended in tragedy.  Now, from her solitary life as a Ranger keeping order across the galaxy, Lanoree has been summoned by the Je''daii Council on a matter of utmost urgency. The leader of a fanatical cult, obsessed with traveling beyond the reaches of known space, is bent on opening a cosmic gateway using dreaded dark matter as the key - risking a cataclysmic reaction that will consume the entire star system. But more shocking to Lanoree than even the prospect of total galactic annihilation, is the decision of her Je''daii Masters to task her with the mission of preventing it. Until a staggering revelation makes clear why she was chosen: The brilliant, dangerous madman she must track down and stop at any cost is the brother whose death she has long grieved - and whose life she must now fear.'

'Darth Plagueis: one of the most brilliant Sith Lords who ever lived. Possessing power is all he desires. Losing it is the only thing he fears. As an apprentice, he embraces the ruthless ways of the Sith. And when the time is right, he destroys his Master—but vows never to suffer the same fate. For like no other disciple of the dark side, Darth Plagueis learns to command the ultimate power... over life and death.  Darth Sidious: Plagueis'' chosen apprentice. Under the guidance of his Master, he secretly studies the ways of the Sith, while publicly rising to power in the galactic government, first as Senator, then as Chancellor, and eventually as Emperor.  Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious, Master and acolyte, target the galaxy for domination — and the Jedi Order for annihilation. But can they defy the merciless Sith tradition? Or will the desire of one to rule supreme, and the dream of the other to live forever, sow the seeds of their destruction?'

But the newest contender in this savage arena, as demonic to behold as he is deadly to challenge, is fighting for more than just survival. His do-or-die mission, for the dark masters he serves, is to capture the ultimate weapon: an object that will enable the Sith to conquer the galaxy.  Sith lords Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious are determined to possess the prize. And one of the power-hungry duo has his own treacherous plans for it. But first, their fearsome apprentice must take on a bloodthirsty prison warden, a cannibal gang, cutthroat crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and an unspeakable alien horror. No one else could brave such a gauntlet of death and live. But no one else is the dreaded dark-side disciple known as Darth Maul.'

With no idea what it is, or how to stop it, Revan may very well fail, for he''s never faced a more powerful and diabolic enemy. But only death can stop him from trying.'

But suddenly her quiet existence among greenhouse and garden specimens is violently destroyed by the arrival of an emissary from Darth Scabrous, a Sith Lord with a fanatical dream poised to become nightmarish reality. For the rare black orchid that Hestizo has nurtured and bonded with is the final ingredient in an ancient Sith formula — crucial to the Dark Lord''s obsession, but with consequences far worse than fatal. Now, spawned by a heretofore unknown virus, the rotting, ravenous dead are rising, driven by a bloodthirsty hunger for all things living — and commanded by a Sith Master who lusts for power and the ultimate prize: immortality... no matter the cost.'

Still, Darth Karrid, commander of the fearsome Imperial battle cruiser Ascendant Spear, continues her relentless efforts to achieve total Sith domination of the galaxy.  But Karrid''s ruthless determination is more than matched in the steely resolve of Theron Shan, whose unfinished business with the Empire could change the course of the war for good. Though the son of a Jedi master, Theron does not wield the Force — but like his renowned mother, the spirit of rebellion is in his blood. As a top covert agent for the Republic, he struck a crucial blow against the Empire by exposing and destroying a Sith superweapon arsenal — which makes him the ideal operative for a daring and dangerous mission to end Ascendant Spear''s reign of terror.  Joined by hot-headed smuggler Teff''ith, with whom he has an inexplicable bond, and wise Jedi warrior Gnost-Dural, Darth Karrid''s former master, Theron must match wits and weapons with a battle-tested crew of the most cold-blooded dark side disciples. But time is brutally short. And if they don''t seize their one chance to succeed, they will surely have countless opportunities to die.'

'In the New York Times bestseller Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, Drew Karpyshyn painted a gripping portrait of a young man''s journey from innocence to evil. That man was Darth Bane, a twisted genius whose iron will, fierce ambition, and strength in the dark side of the Force made him a natural leader among the Sith – until his radical embrace of an all-but-forgotten wisdom drove him to destroy his own order... and create it anew from the ashes. As the last surviving Sith, Darth Bane promulgated a harsh new directive: the Rule of Two.  Two there should be; no more, no less.  One to embody the power, the other to crave it.  Now Darth Bane is ready to put his policy into action, and he thinks he has found the key element that will make his triumph complete: a student to train in the ways of the dark side. Though she is young, Zannah possesses an instinctive link to the dark side that rivals his own. With his guidance, she will become essential in his quest to destroy the Jedi and dominate the galaxy.  But there is one who is determined to stop Darth Bane: Johun Othone, Padawan to Jedi Master Lord Hoth, who died at Bane''s hands in the last great Sith War. Though the rest of the Jedi scoff at him, Joshua''s belief that there are surviving Sith on the loose is unshakeable.  As Johun continues his dogged pursuit of the man who killed his master, Zannah, faced unexpectedly with a figure from her past, begins to question her embrace of the dark side. And Darth Bane is led by Force-induced visions to a moon where he will acquire astonishing new knowledge and power – power that will alter him in ways he could never have imagined...'

'Twenty years have passed since Darth Bane, reigning Dark Lord of the Sith, demolished the ancient order devoted to the dark side and reinvented it as a circle of two: one Master to wield the power and pass on the wisdom, and one apprentice to learn, challenge, and ultimately usurp the Dark Lord in a duel to the death. But Bane''s acolyte, Zannah, has yet to engage her Master in mortal combat and prove herself a worthy successor. Determined that the Sith dream of galactic domination will not die with him, Bane vows to learn the secret of a forgotten Dark Lord that will assure the Sith''s immortality – and his own.  A perfect opportunity arises when a Jedi emissary is assassinated on the troubled mining planet Doan, giving Bane an excuse to dispatch his apprentice on a fact-finding mission–while he himself sets out in secret to capture the ancient holocron of Darth Andeddu and its precious knowledge. But Zannah is no fool. She knows that her ruthless Master has begun to doubt her, and she senses that he is hiding something crucial to her future. If she is going to claim the power she craves, she must take action now.  While Bane storms the remote stronghold of a fanatical Sith cult, Zannah prepares for her Master''s downfall by choosing an apprentice of her own: a rogue Jedi cunning and cold-blooded enough to embrace the Sith way and to stand beside her when she at last wrests from Bane the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith.  But Zannah is not the only one with the desire and power to destroy Darth Bane. Princess Serra of the Doan royal family is haunted by memories of the monstrous Sith soldier who murdered her father and tortured her when she was a child. Bent on retribution, she hires a merciless assassin to find her tormentor – and bring him back alive to taste her wrath.  Only a Sith who has taken down her own Master can become Dark Lord of the Sith. So when Bane suddenly vanishes, Zannah must find him – possibly even rescue him – before she can kill him. And so she pursues her quarry from the grim depths of a ravaged world on the brink of catastrophe to the barren reaches of a desert outpost, where the future of the dark side''s most powerful disciples will be decided, once and for all, by the final, fatal stroke of a lightsaber.'

'There is a great disturbance in the Force... From the sleek ships of the glimmering Coruscant skyscape to the lush gardens of pastoral Naboo, dissent is roiling. The Republic is failing, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, elected ten years earlier to save the crumbling government. Separatists threaten war, and the Senate is hopelessly divided, unable to determine whether to raise an army for battle or keep the fragile peace. It is a stalemate that once broken, could lead to galactic chaos.  Mischievous and resolved, courageous to the point of recklessness, Anakin Skywalker has come of age in a time of great upheaval. The nineteen-year-old apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi is an enigma to the Jedi Council, and a challenge to his Jedi Master. Time has not dulled Anakin''s ambition, nor has his Jedi training tamed his independent streak. When an attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala''s life brings them together for the first time in ten years, it is clear that time also has not dulled Anakin''s intense feelings for the beautiful diplomat.  The attack on Senator Amidala just before a crucial vote thrusts the Republic even closer to the edge of disaster. Masters Yoda and Mace Windu sense enormous unease. The dark side is growing, clouding the Jedi''s perception of the events. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, a slow rumble is building into the roar of thousands of soldiers readying for battle. But even as the Republic falters around them, Anakin and Padmé find a connection so intense that all else begins to fall away. Anakin will lose himself—and his way—in emotions a Jedi, sworn to hold allegiance only to the Order, is forbidden to have.  Based on the story by George Lucas and the screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales, this intense and revealing novel by bestselling author R. A. Salvatore sheds new light on the legend of Star Wars—and skillfully illuminates one of our most beloved sagas.'

In Episode III Revenge of the Sith the fates of key players on both sides of the conflict will be sealed. But first, crucial events that pave the way to that time of reckoning unfold in a labyrinth of evil...  Capturing Trade Federation Viceroy–and Separatist Councilmember–Nute Gunray is the mission that brings Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, with a squad of clones in tow, to Neimoidia. But the treacherous ally of the Sith proves as slippery as ever, evading his Jedi pursuers even as they narrowly avoid deadly disaster. Still, their daring efforts yield an unexpected prize: a unique holotransceiver that bears intelligence capable of leading the Republic forces to their ultimate quarry, the ever-elusive Darth Sidious.  Swiftly taking up the chase, Anakin and Obi-Wan follow clues from the droid factories of Charros IV to the far-flung worlds of the Outer Rim... every step bringing them closer to pinpointing the location of the Sith Lord–whom they suspect has been manipulating every aspect of the Separatist rebellion. Yet somehow, in the escalating galaxy-wide chess game of strikes, counterstrikes, ambushes, sabotage, and retaliations, Sidious stays constantly one move ahead.  Then the trail takes a shocking turn. For Sidious and his minions have set in motion a ruthlessly orchestrated campaign to divide and overwhelm the Jedi forces–and bring the Republic to its knees.'

'It began as the ultimate voyage of discovery – only to become the stuff of lost Republic legend... and a dark chapter in Jedi history. Now, at last, acclaimed author Timothy Zahn returns to tell the whole extraordinary story of the remarkable – and doomed–Outbound Flight Project.  The Clone Wars have yet to erupt when Jedi Master Jorus C''baoth petitions the Senate for support of a singularly ambitious undertaking. Six Jedi Masters, twelve Jedi Knights, and fifty thousand men, women, and children will embark–aboard a gargantuan vessel, equipped for years of travel – on a mission to contact intelligent life and colonize undiscovered worlds beyond the known galaxy. The government bureaucracy threatens to scuttle the expedition before it can even start–until Master C''baoth foils a murderous conspiracy plot, winning him the political capital he needs to set in motion the dream of Outbound Flight.  Or so it would seem. For unknown to the famed Jedi Master, the successful launch of the mission is secretly being orchestrated by an unlikely ally: the evil Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, who has his own reasons for wanting Outbound Flight to move forward...  and, ultimately, to fail.  Yet Darth Sidious is not the mission''s most dangerous challenge. Once underway, the starship crosses paths at the edge of Unknown Space with the forces of the alien Chiss Ascendancy and the brilliant mastermind best known as “Thrawn.” Even Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, aboard Outbound Flight with his young Padawan student, Anakin Skywalker, cannot help avert disaster. Thus what begins as a peaceful Jedi mission is violently transformed into an all-out war for survival against staggering odds – and the most diabolical of adversaries.  Timothy Zahn''s unique mix of espionage, political gamesmanship, and deadly interstellar combat breathes electrifying life into a Star Wars legend.'

A backwater planet on the edge of civilized space. And an unlikely place to find a Jedi Master in hiding, or an orphaned infant boy on whose tiny shoulders rests the future of a galaxy.

But as tensions escalate between the farmers and a tribe of Sand People led by a ruthless war chief, Ben finds himself drawn into the fight, endangering the very mission that brought him to Tatooine.  Ben — Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, hero of the Clone Wars, traitor to the Empire, and protector of the galaxy''s last hope — can no more turn his back on evil than he can reject his Jedi training. And when blood is unjustly spilled, innocent lives threatened, and a ruthless opponent unmasked, Ben has no choice but to call on the wisdom of the Jedi — and the formidable power of the Force — in his never-ending fight for justice.'

'When the Imperial prison barge Purge — temporary home to five hundred of the galaxy''s most ruthless killers, rebels, scoundrels, and thieves — breaks down in a distant part of space, its only hope appears to lie with a Star Destroyer found drifting and seemingly abandoned.  But when a boarding party from the Purge is sent to scavenge for parts, only half of them come back—bringing with them a horrific disease so lethal that within hours nearly all aboard the Purge die in ways too hideous to imagine.  And death is only the beginning.  The Purge''s half-dozen survivors will do whatever it takes to stay alive.  But nothing can prepare them for what lies waiting aboard the Star Destroyer.  For the dead are rising: soulless, unstoppable, and unspeakably hungry.'

The Empire stands at the brink of total collapse.  But they have saved their most heinous plan for last.  First a plot is hatched that could destroy the New Republic in a bloodbath of genocide and civil war.  Then comes the shocking news that Grand Admiral Thrawn — the most cunning and ruthless warlord in history — has apparently returned from the dead to lead the Empire to a long-prophesied victory.  Facing incredible odds, Han and Leia begin a desperate race against time to prevent the New Republic from unraveling in the face of two inexplicable threats — one from within and one from without.  Meanwhile, Luke teams up with Mara Jade, using the Force to track down a mysterious pirate ship with a crew of clones.  Yet, perhaps most dangerous of all, are those who lurk in the shadows, orchestrating a dark plan that will turn the New Republic and the Empire into their playthings.'

'Sometimes it seems a Jedi''s work is never done and Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker know this only too well.  Despite the bond they share in the Force, after three years of marriage the Jedi Master and his wife are still learning the ropes of being a couple — and struggling to find time together between the constant demands of duty.  But all that will change when they''re united on an unexpected mission — and must pool their exceptional skills to combat an insidious enemy...  and salvage a part of Jedi history.  It begins with a message from a surprising source: Nirauan, the planet where Thrawn, dangerous disciple of Emperor Palpatine, once held sway...  and from which Luke and Mara barely escaped with their lives.  The message itself is shocking.  After fifty years, the remains of Outbound Flight — a pioneering Jedi expedition viciously destroyed by Thrawn — have been found on Nirauan.  Now, the fiercely honor-bound aliens who reside there wish to turn over the remnants of the doomed mission to the New Republic.  Accepting the gesture will mean a long voyage into the treacherous cluster of stars where the thousands of souls aboard the Outbound Flight vessel met their grim fate.  But it may also mean something more...  something that has stirred an inexplicable sense of foreboding in Mara.  Whatever may await, the Skywalkers will not face it alone.  Joining them on the strange and solemn journey are an officer of the post-Palpatine Empire,  escorted by a detachment of Imperial stormtroopers;  a party of diplomats from a gentle alien species that reveres the fallen Jedi for saving them from bloodthirsty conquerors;  and a New Republic ambassador who harbors his own mysterious agenda.  Soon enough, suspicion, secrecy, and an unknown saboteur run rampant aboard the isolated ship.  But it is within the derelict walls of Outbound Flight itself, buried for half a century on a desolate planetoid, where the gravest danger lies.  As the marooned hulk yields up stunning revelations and unexpected terrors to its visitors, Luke and Mara find all they stand for — and their very existence — brutally challenged.  And the ultimate test will be surviving the deathtrap carefully laid by foes who are legendary for their ruthlessness...  and determined to complete the job Thrawn began: exterminating the Jedi.'

In the outlying systems, where the Trade Federation maintains a stranglehold on shipping routes, tensions are boiling over — while back in the comfort of Coruscant, the hub of civilized space and seat of the Republic government, few senators seem inclined to investigate the problem.  And those who suspect Supreme Chancellor Valorum of having a hand in the machinations are baffled — especially when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi foil an assassination attempt on the Chancellor.  With the crisis escalating, Valorum calls for an emergency trade summit.  As humans and aliens gather, conspiracies sealed with large sums of money run rampant, and no one is entirely above suspicion.  But the greatest threat of all remains unknown to everyone except three members of the Trade Federation who have entered into a shadowy alliance with a dark overlord.  While the trio will be content with more money and fewer problems, Darth Sidious has grander, far more terrifying plans.  It is a time that tests the mettle of all those who strive to hold the Republic together — none more so than the Jedi Knights, who have long been the galaxy''s best hope for preserving peace and justice.  Yet despite their most valiant efforts, the meeting will explode into fiery chaos beyond everyone''s worst fears... '

Then one of his Neimoidian contacts disappears, and Sidious does not need his Force-honed instincts to suspect betrayal. He orders his apprentice, Darth Maul, to hunt the traitor down.  But he is too late.  The secret has already passed into the hands of information broker Lorn Pavan, which places him right at the top of Darth Maul''s hit list.

Commanding a Separatist invasion force more than one million strong, the cunning financier-turned-warrior lays siege to the planet Praesitlyn, home of the strategic intergalactic communications center that is key to the Republic''s survival in the Clone Wars.  Left unchallenged, this decisive strike could indeed pave the way for the toppling of more Republic worlds...  and ultimate victory for the Separatists.  Retaliation must be swift and certain.  But engaging the enemy throughout the galaxy has already stretched Supreme Chancellor Palpatine''s armies to the limit. There is no choice but to move against the surging waves of invading battle-droids on Praesitlyn with only a small contingent of clone soldiers. Commanding them will be Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon – hand-picked by the Council for the do-or-die mission. And at his side, skilled young starfighter pilot Anakin Skywalker, a promising young Jedi Padawan eager to be freed of the bonds of apprenticeship – and to be awarded the title of Jedi Knight.  Shoulder to shoulder with a rogue Republic army officer and his battle-hardened crew, a hulking Rondian mercenary with an insatiable taste for combat, and a duo of ready-for-anything soldiers, the Jedi generals take to the skies and the punishing desert terrain of occupied Praesitlyn – to bring the battle to the Separatist forces.  Already outnumbered and outgunned, when confronted with an enemy ultimatum that could lead to the massacre of innocents, they may also be out of options.  Unless Anakin Skywalker can strike a crucial balance between the wisdom born of the Force...  and the instincts of a born warrior.'
